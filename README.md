## 🚀 What This Site Actually Is

A **React-powered PlayStation game store**, because why use Shopify when you can suffer in JSX? 😌
Built with **love, caffeine, and way too many “npm start” restarts**.

## 🧠 Features (or lack thereof)

* ✅ **Beautiful game cards** – because aesthetics matter more than sleep.
* ✅ **Pagination** – scroll forever? Nah, we civilized.
* ✅ **Dynamic QR codes** – scan it like a pro.
* ✅ **WhatsApp for purchase** – no login, no cart, just pure chaos.
* 🚫 **No Auth** – trust-based economy.
* 🚫 **No Cart** – buy one game, or ten, manually.
